# jQuery Superclick Dropdown Menu Plugin

This plugin shares many of [Superfish](https://github.com/joeldbirch/superfish)'s features and all of its CSS. However, Superclick focusses solely on click events to open and close submenus. Bear in mind, this means that links with associated submenus will never be followed, they will simply toggle the visibility of the submenu.

## Documentation and Demos

For now, please use the [existing Superfish documentation](http://users.tpg.com.au/j_birch/plugins/superfish/) where you will find full explanations of the customisable features. The only differences are:

- options related to hovers are omitted from Superclick.
- the `hoverClass` option is changed to `activeClass`.
- there is no need to include the hoverIntent plugin.

Here is a [quick demo of Superclick in action](http://users.tpg.com.au/j_birch/plugins/superclick/example.html).
